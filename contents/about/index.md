Hi,  I am Karolin Varner

You found my website and you are even trying to find out
what this is;   that's some attention - *wow, thanks*!

So, here are the basics: I was born 1993 in Munich, Germany
and I am still living there to this very moment.  I work as
a freelance programmer and and participate in many open
source projects.  Besides my programming/IT activities a
also play Bass (both double bass and electric) and I produce
the nachtschmoker podcast in which I read short stories.

This website is intened to be a collection of my public
activity.

### Hire me!

At the age of six I joind the Klenze elementary school.
Afterwards I attended the Pestalozzi Gymnasium, where I
stayd untill the tenth grade and earned a medium school
degree.  Instad of continuing on the Pestalozzi Gymnasium I
switched to the technical FOS (topic specific higher
education school) which I quickly cancled for social
reasons, however I still learned a lot about electrical
engeneering.  At the moment I am doing an apprentiship as a
Assistent for IT in order to earn the necessary degrees to
study at a University.

I offer the following services on a freelance basis:

* Linux system administration and consulting
* Application developement
* Desktop support
* Web programming with limited web design
* Client side programming for Websites

I have good knowledge of the following technologies:

* Programming languages:
    * Python
    * Javascript and Coffescript
    * node.js
    * C
    * PHP
    * Ruby
    * Shell
    * Java
* SCM
    * Git
    * Svn
    * Bazaar
* Other technologies:
    * HTML
    * CSS
    * SQL

Further I have limited knowledge of the following
technologies:

* Embedded systems
* Distributed Systems
* Ruby, Ruby on Rails
* C++

I regard the ability to use different systems, to quickly
learn new technologies and to work with data (network
protokolls, files)

### Trans

if you have made it this far down, there is a last detail
you should know: I am transsexuell; to brake it down: I was
born a guy, but feel that I am girl; please don't confuse
with transvestisim where you run a round with rediciolusly
oversexed clothes but still stuff your genitals with
cushions (also read the Wikipage).

In case you meet me in person (especially if you are
planning to have a job interview with me -- which would be
awesome btw): I suppose my apperance does not quite fit the
description above; I try do fit in as good as I can --
mostly by choosing the standard geek t-shirt and jeans
combination and looking too male for my liking.

This is the end (my friend),
so long and thenks for reading and all the fish

Karo
