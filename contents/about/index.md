Hi,  I am Karolin Varner

You found my website and you are even trying to find out
what this is;   that's some attention - *wow, thanks*!

So, here are the basics: I was born 1993 in Munich, Germany
and I am still living there to this very moment.  I work as
a freelance programmer and participate in a few open
source projects. Besides my programming/IT activities a
also play Bass (both double bass and electric) and I produce
the nachtschmoker podcast in which I read short stories.

This website is intend to be a collection of my public
activity.

### Hire me!

#### Curriculum vitae

At the age of six I joined the Klenze elementary school.
Afterwards I attended the Pestalozzi Gymnasium, where I
stayed until the tenth grade and earned a medium school
degree. Afterwards I switched to the technical FOS (topic specific higher
education school) which I canceled for social
reasons.
Still, I learned a lot about electrical engineering while attending this school.
At the moment I am doing an apprenticeship as an technical assistant
in order to expand my knowledge about electronics and hardware in general.
After I finish this part of my life I plan to study engineering or informatics.

#### Skills

I offer the following services on a freelance basis:

* Web applications with focus on rich clients
* Generic-purpose application development
* Basic web and print design
* Linux system administration and support
* Desktop support

I have good knowledge of the following technologies:

* Programming languages:
    * Python
    * Javascript and Coffescript
    * node.js
    * C
    * PHP
    * Ruby
    * Shell
    * Java
* SCM
    * Git
    * Svn
    * Bazaar
* Other technologies:
    * HTML
    * CSS
    * SQL

Further I have limited knowledge of the following
technologies:

* Embedded systems
* Distributed systems (for heavy-loads)
* Ruby, Ruby on Rails
* C++

I consider the abilities to use different systems, to quickly
learn new technologies and to work with data (network
protocols, files) as base-skills.

### Trans

If you have made it this far down, there is a last detail
you should know: I am transsexual; to brake it down: I was
born a guy, but feel that I am girl; please don't confuse
with transvestisim or cross-dressing which is males takeing
joy in wearing women's clothes
(also read the [Wikipage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transsexualism)).

In case you meet me in person (especially if you are
planning to have a job interview with me: 
I suppose my appearance does not quite fit the
description above; I try do fit in as good as I can -
mostly by choosing the standard geek T-shirt/dress shirt and jeans
combination and looking too male for my liking.



This is the end (my friend),
so long and thenks and all the fish and reading
