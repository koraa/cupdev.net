I am Karolin Varner, a programmer living in Germany who is
mostly doing work as a freelance programmer and participate
in a bunch of open source projects.  Besides IT stuff I am
also playing electric bass.

This website is intend to be a collection of my public
activity.

### Hire me!

#### Skills

I offer the following services on a freelance basis:

* Programming (Node.js, Rails, Posix/C)
* Basic web design
* Linux system administration and support including some
  more advanced topics like full disc encryption, ZFS,
  complex networking setups, docker, LXC and KVM.

I know a lot of programming languages and am very happy to
learn new ones (I am particularly eager to get in touch more
with HDLs like VHDL and Verilog and functional Languages
like Haskell and Erlang).
Among the languages I know relatively well are JS,
Coffeescript, Python, C and Ruby.

I consider the abilities to use different systems, to quickly
learn new technologies and to work with data (network
protocols, file formats, data structures…) as the very
foundation of any programming skills.

I am doing a lot of work for [Soup.io](http://soup.io) at
the moment and in the past I have done work for [Videri
Concept](http://www.videri-concept.de/) and a lot of smaller
companies.
Also check out my open source projects on
[GitHub](https://github.com/koraa).

I charge 45€ per hour.
