I am Karolin Varner, a programmer living in Germany,
doing work in various projects and participating
in a bunch of open source projects. Besides the IT stuff I am
also playing electric bass.

This website is intend to be a collection of my public
activity.

### Hire me!

#### Skills

I can offer the following skills

* Programming (Node.js, Rails, Posix/C)
* Linux system administration and support including some
  more advanced topics like full disc encryption, ZFS,
  complex networking setups, docker, LXC and KVM.

I know a lot of programming languages and am very happy to
learn new ones (I am particularly eager to get in touch more
with HDLs like VHDL and Verilog and functional Languages
like Haskell and Erlang).
Among the languages I know pretty well are JS,
Coffeescript, Python, C and Ruby.

I consider the abilities to use different systems, to quickly
learn new technologies and to work with data (network
protocols, file formats, data structuresâ€¦) as the very
foundation of any programming skills.

I am doing a lot of work for [Soup.io](http://soup.io) and
the [PREMIUM Map](https://github.com/premium-cola/premium-map).
In the past I have done work for [Videri Concept](http://www.videri-concept.de/)
and a lot of smaller companies.
In the last year I started working a lot on the open source
game [Inexor](https://github.com/inexor-game/code).
Check out  [GitHub](https://github.com/koraa) to find some
of my other open source projects.
