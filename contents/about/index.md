I am Karolin Varner, a programmer living in Germany,
doing work in various projects and participating
in a bunch of open source projects. Besides the IT stuff I am
also playing electric bass.

If you are interested in me personally rather than my work,
my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dakoraa) and my
[Soup](http://korra.soup.io/) are probably the best places
to go!

I do programming in various programming languages
(javascript/coffeescript client and server side, python,
ruby/rails, java, C, C++14) and I have quite a bit of
experience with devops.

I would very much like to get in touch more programming
languages, so if you have a project in HDLs or functional
languages (haskell, vhdl, verilog, scala, erlang, ...) or
interesting scientific applications – drop me a mail!

I consider the abilities to use different systems, to quickly
learn new technologies and to work with data (network
protocols, file formats, data structures…) as the very
foundation of any programming skills.

Besides purely technical topics I think communication is
one of the most critical aspects of every project. My work
has always included planning projects and closely working
with customers and management to ensure excellent knowledge
about the state, the goals and the time schedule a project.

At the moment I am doing lot's of work for [Softwear](http://nl.softwear.nl/) (sic!)
where my responsibilities include writing low level database servicing software in
C++14 for our mongodb infrastructure, data modeling and rich client applications with
angular.js.
Before that I worked on soup  [Soup.io](http://soup.io) (Ruby on Rails) and
the [PREMIUM Map](https://github.com/premium-cola/premium-map), and a lot of smaller companies.
For about two years now I writing C++ code for the open source
game [Inexor](https://github.com/inexor-game/code) where
I am mainly concerned with data management, build systems
and modern communication protocols and scripting language
integration.
Check out  [GitHub](https://github.com/koraa) to find some
of my other open source projects.
